    "You have been in a fancy restaurant with four of your best friends. All the individual bills are brought to the table and it is time to add the tip and to compute everyoneâ€™s share. Since nobody ordered anything extravagantly expensive, you decide that everyone will pay an equal share of the bill.\n",

    "Inside your program, you have to declare Eleven variables: one for each of the names and one for each of the bills. Assume the group has five people. Request names of the five attendees and store them in variables â€˜name1â€™, â€¦, â€˜name5â€™. Then assign bills for each person and store each of them in the corresponding variables: â€˜bill1â€™, â€¦,â€™bill5â€™. Print out both of those sets of variables. Next, ask for input for the tip percentage and compute and print the total bill and the amount each person must pay.\n",
