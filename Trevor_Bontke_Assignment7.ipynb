    "#### OBJECTIVE\n",

    "You will practice how to read numerical and text data from the command line, do simple arithmetic computations, and to output results to the terminal, but this time using a dictionary to store the data.\n",

    "THE PROBLEM\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been in a fancy restaurant with four of your best friends. All the individual bills are brought to the table and it is time to add the tip and to compute everyoneâ€™s share. Since nobody ordered anything extravagantly expensive, you decide that everyone will pay an equal share of the bill.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of friends variable `number_of_friends` is already provided for you as function parameter and initialized with a default value of 5. Inside your program, you have to declare 1 (ONE) new variable called `record`: which is simply  a dictionary of storing both names  and  bills for each attendee. Assume the group has five or more people.  Request names of the attendees and bills for each person and store each of them in the corresponding dictionary variable  `record`. Hint w.r.t. to `record` dictionary, for each entry the `key` will be the name of the attendee and the `value` is the bill for that attendee.  Print out both the name and  bill for each attendee. Next, ask for input for the tip percentage and compute and print the total bill. Last, print out the amount each attendee must pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You  must  use the number_of_friends variable in defining the number of iterations for your  loop (either for or while loop)   and the size or length of your dictinary must match the value of number_of_friends.   All variables must be declared except (number_of_friends)  and used.  You will get a ZERO if you do  not comply with the instructions.\n",
