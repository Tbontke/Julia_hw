    "\n",
    "You have been in a fancy restaurant with four of your best friends. All the individual bills are brought to the table and it is time to add the tip and to compute everyone’s share. Since nobody ordered anything extravagantly expensive, you decide that everyone will pay an equal share of the bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of friends variable \"number_of_friends\" is already provided for you as a function parameter and initialized with a default value of 5. Inside your program, you have to declare 2 new variables: one for a list of names and for a list of bills. Assume the group has five or more people.  Request names of the attendees and store them in the list ‘names’. Then assign bills for each person and store them in the corresponding list variable  ‘bills’.  Print out both of those variables. Next, ask for input for the tip percentage and compute and print the total bill and the amount each person must pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You must use the number_of_friends variable in defining the number of iterations for your loop (either for or while loop)   and the size or length of your lists must match the value of number_of_friends.   All variables must be declared except (number_of_friends)  and used.  You will get a ZERO if you do not comply with the instructions.\n",
