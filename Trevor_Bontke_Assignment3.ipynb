    "Kids Game Develop a simple game that teaches kindergartners how to multiply single-digit numbers. Your function game() will take an integer n as input and then ask n single-digit multiplication questions. The numbers to be multiplied should be chosen randomly from the range [0, 9] (i.e.,0 to 9 inclusive). The user will enter the answer when prompted. Your function should print 'Correct' for correct answers and 'Incorrect' for incorrect answers. After n questions, your function should print the number of correct answers.\n",

    "     This program is designed to become familiar with functions. The function mathGame() is desigined to ask the user a number (n) of multiplication questions. The multiplication is of two random numbers between 0 and 9. User input is requested for each problem and the answer is immediately provided before moving on. At the end of the function the user is told how well they did based on the number of problems answered correctly. In the special case that they got no answers correct the user is encouraged to try again and recursion of the function is initiated if \"y\" is entered by the user. The main focus of my program was to make the output as encourage as possible for young children. \"\"\""
